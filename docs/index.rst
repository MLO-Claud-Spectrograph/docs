MLO CLASSI Spectrograph
=======================

This site is the unified user and developer documentation for the software
supporting the MLO CLASSI (Claud Low-resolution Array-fed Small Scale Integral
field) spectrograph. The software is split into focused repositories, but users
should approach the instrument as one system rather than learning each
repository in isolation.

The normal path through the software is:

                   v
            extracted spectra

Reference throughput curves, detector-response data, atmospheric-extinction
data, and template spectra are shared across packages through the
``spectrograph-shared-data`` distribution where practical.
