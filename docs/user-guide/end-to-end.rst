End-to-end workflow
===================

The following sequence is the intended mental model for using the full software
stack.

Before the night
----------------

#. Obtain a representative target or transient template spectrum.
#. Use the ETC to scale it to the expected target magnitude and estimate the
   exposure time needed in the diagnostic wavelength region.
#. If the target is near a sensitivity limit or trace-overlap behavior matters,
   run the simulator with the same instrument geometry and exposure time.
#. Inspect the simulated detector frame and, when useful, run it through the
   pipeline as a pre-observation sanity check.

At the telescope
----------------

#. Start the ICS with the deployment configuration appropriate to the
   observatory host.
#. Verify science-camera, focus, guide-camera/stage, and telescope status.
#. Acquire calibration data required by the pipeline configuration.
#. Acquire science exposures using the ETC result as the starting exposure
   time, adjusting for actual conditions when needed.
#. Inspect the current FITS frame in the ICS interface, but retain the original
   raw files as the authoritative data products.

After acquisition
-----------------

#. Process the detector calibrations.
#. Trace and boxcar-extract every useful fiber with the current Level-1 path;
   use Horne/optimal extraction only when explicitly selecting that available
   implementation.
#. Apply wavelength calibration and propagate masks and uncertainties.
#. Perform sky/background subtraction at a stage that preserves the individual
   fiber measurements needed for quality control.
#. Combine exposures only after verifying trace registration and calibration
   consistency.
#. Export or analyze the final one-dimensional spectra.

Reproducibility
---------------

Record the versions (or Git commit hashes) of the ETC, simulator, pipeline, and
``spectrograph-shared-data`` distribution used for an observation or simulation
campaign. A change to a throughput curve can alter both the ETC prediction and
the simulator even when no Python source code changes.
