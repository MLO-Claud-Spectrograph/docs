System architecture
===================

Scientific data flow
--------------------

The software stack has three layers:

#. **Reference data** -- throughput curves, atmospheric extinction, detector
   response data, and template spectra.
#. **Scientific modeling and reduction** -- ETC, simulator, and pipeline.
#. **Instrument operation** -- the ICS and hardware-specific adapters.

The ``shared-data`` package is the common dependency at the bottom of the
scientific stack. It prevents the ETC and simulator from silently diverging
because each repository carries its own stale copy of the same throughput or
reference spectrum.

Instrument model
----------------

The current simulator describes the spectrograph from physical inputs rather
than asking callers to enter derived detector quantities. Important inputs
include detector pixel size, grating groove density, incidence and diffraction
angles, collimator and camera focal lengths, fiber core diameter, fiber pitch,
and diffraction order.

From these, the model derives quantities such as:

* central wavelength from the grating equation;
* wavelength dispersion at the detector;
* camera/collimator magnification;
* anamorphic factor;
* projected fiber pitch in detector pixels; and
* spatial and spectral fiber widths in detector pixels.

This is important for consistency: changing a physical element of the
instrument should automatically change all dependent detector-space quantities.

Fiber geometry
--------------

The instrument is modeled as a linear multi-fiber input/output. The simulator
supports one input spectrum per fiber and lays the traces out according to the
physical fiber pitch projected through the spectrograph. The software should not
assume that the present fiber count is immutable; the count is a model
parameter.

Hardware-control boundary
-------------------------

The ICS isolates device-specific interfaces behind backend objects. Development
can use mock devices, while the instrument-side deployment can use INDI for the
science camera/focus hardware and ACE Connector-backed interfaces for telescope
and guide-side devices.

A separate read-only ACE bridge is useful where the vendor Python bindings only
run on a particular x86 Python installation. That bridge should be treated as a
narrow compatibility service, not as a general remote-execution API.
