Development and documentation maintenance
=========================================

Repository boundaries
---------------------

Keep broadly reusable science logic independent of observatory hardware. The
ETC, simulator, pipeline, and shared-data repositories should remain usable on a
normal scientific Python installation. Hardware-specific INDI/ACE integration
belongs in the ICS or a narrowly scoped adapter/service.

Shared data
-----------

When a throughput or reference spectrum is used by more than one package, move
it to ``shared-data`` and update the dependent packages together. Avoid fixing a
scientific discrepancy by editing separate copies of the same curve in multiple
repositories.

Documentation updates
---------------------

Update this site when a change alters any of the following:

* the end-user workflow;
* a public class/function/interface shown in the package pages;
* physical or unit conventions;
* configuration keys used for deployment;
* the meaning or format of a data product; or
* which repository owns a piece of functionality.

Package-internal refactors do not need to be mirrored here unless they affect a
public interface.

Building the docs
-----------------

Run a strict build before merging documentation changes:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   make html-strict

GitHub Pages deployment also uses ``-W --keep-going``, so warnings fail CI while
still reporting as many problems as possible in a single run.

Future API documentation
------------------------

This repository deliberately contains stable, hand-maintained user-facing API
summaries rather than importing all package source trees during every docs
build. Once package public APIs settle, each package can generate detailed
``autodoc``/``autosummary`` reference pages in its own CI and this site can link
to them with Intersphinx.

That approach avoids making the unified documentation deployment depend on
observatory-only drivers, GUI libraries, or every package's complete runtime
environment.
